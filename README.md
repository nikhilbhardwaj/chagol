# Chagol

Chagol is a ruby gem that you can use to send text messages to any
mobile phone in India using a service provider like way2sms or 160by2.
It can be used from the command line as well as from other ruby scripts
and applications.

## Usage

This will be updated once I come up with a design for the command line
script.
